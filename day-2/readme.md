## Activity 1 : Arithematic Operations
* **Task 1** : Write a program to add 2 numbers and log the result to the console.
* **Task 2** : Substract 2 numbers and log the result to the console.
* **Task 3** : Multiply 2 numbers and log the result to the console.
* **Task 4** : Divide 2 numbers and log the result to the console.
* **Task 5** : find Remainder of 2 numbers and log the result to the console.
## Activity 2 : Assignment Operators
* **Task 6** : use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result on the console.
* **Task 7** : use the -= operator to substract a number from a variable and log the result on the console.
## Activity 3 : Comparison Operator
* **Task 8** : compare 2 number using greater than (>) and less than (<) operator and log the result on the console.
* **Task 9** : compare 2 numbers using greater than equal to (>=) and less than equal to (<=) operator and log the result on the console.
* **Task 10** : compare 2 numbers using == and === operators and log the result on the console.
* **Task 11** : Compare two numbers using the inequality operator (!=) and log the result
## Activity 4 : Logical Operators
* **Task 12**: Use the AND operator (&&) to combine two conditions and log the result
* **Task 13**: Use the OR operator (||) to combine two conditions and log the result
* **Task 14:** Use the NOT operator (!) to negate a condition and log the result
## Activity 5 : Ternary Operator
* **Task 15** : USE the ternary operator to check number is positive or negative and show the result on the console
